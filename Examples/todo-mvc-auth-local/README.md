# Objectives

- It's a beginner level app created to understand how MVC concept and logins are added

---

# Who is this for? 

- It's for beginners & intermediates with little more experience, to help understand the various aspects of building a node app with some complex features

---

# Packages/Dependencies used 

connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

`npm install` 

---

# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file in the config-folder and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 2121 (can be any port example: 3000) 
  - DB_STRING: `your database URI` 
  <br>(eg. mongodb+srv://ReadMongo:81468146@cluster0.59cir.mongodb.net/todo?retryWrites=true&w=majority)

#### public
* css / style.css: css formating for the ejs-files
