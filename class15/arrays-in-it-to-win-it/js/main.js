//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
films = ["Terminator","Rocky","Rambo"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const filmOne = films[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const lengthArr = films.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index?
// Would your solution still work?
const lastElement = films[films.length - 1]
